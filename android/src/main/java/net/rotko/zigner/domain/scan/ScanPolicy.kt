/**
 * What the camera is allowed to hand to a parser.
 *
 * The camera is this app's only untrusted input. Everything an attacker
 * controls arrives through it, and the scan dispatcher routes purely on the
 * content of the payload - a six-character prefix decides which parser runs.
 * Nothing consulted the user about it, so the reachable attack surface was
 * the UNION of every chain compiled in, not the subset anyone actually uses.
 *
 * A user who has never touched Penumbra could still have 433 lines of
 * hand-rolled protobuf parsing executed by pointing their camera at a QR
 * code. That parser is also among the least exercised code in the app, which
 * makes it a worse place to be wrong than the code people use daily.
 *
 * So: deny by default, and route only what has been explicitly turned on.
 * This does not delete anything - it makes unused parsers unreachable, which
 * is the property that actually matters and is reversible in a way that
 * deleting 30k lines is not.
 *
 * The gate is checked BEFORE a payload reaches a parser. Prefix matching to
 * classify the payload is a fixed-length string comparison and is not itself
 * the thing being defended against.
